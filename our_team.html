    <h6><span class="italics2">Founder &amp; CEO</span> David Dill</h6>
      <p>David Dill was born and raised in Michigan. He attended Oakland University in Rochester, MI, where he majored in Marketing and Finance. David loves his home state and still spends much of his time there, although he travels frequently to visit Customers in their locations. Centering his actions around Customers has been a lifelong focus for David. After college, David worked as a Private Wealth Manager for Huntington National Bank. It was his passion for delivering excellent Customer Service that powered David's success. His banking clients, and family's encouragement, inspired him to become a young entreprenuer. <span class="read-more team">Read More</span></p>

<p style="display:none;">David incorporated Synergy Appraisal Services sixteen years ago with one simple premise: To
provide exceptional Customer Service that is uniquely designed to meet the specific business
needs of each Client. David's philosophy is to develop Win-Win-Win solutions, which are
sustainable, to deliver exceptional results for Customers.
<Br><Br>Understanding that service is only part of a winning formula for his Customers, David also
became an early advocate of implementing a quality control function to mitigate risk and
strengthen credit quality. It is no mystery why David's passion for excellent service and consistent quality has made him very successful and endeared him to Customers.
