    <h6><span class="italics2">Founder &amp; CEO</span> David Dill <a href="mailto:david@synergyappraisal.com"><img src="img/mail2.png"> david@synergyappraisal.com</a></h6>
      <p>David Dill was born and raised in Michigan. He attended Oakland University in Rochester, MI, where he majored in Marketing and Finance. David loves his home state and still spends much of his time there, although he travels frequently to visit Customers in their locations. Centering his actions around Customers has been a lifelong focus for David. After college, David worked as a Private Wealth Manager for Huntington National Bank. It was his passion for delivering excellent Customer Service that powered David's success. His banking clients, and family's encouragement, inspired him to become a young entreprenuer. <span class="read-more team">Read More</span></p>

<p style="display:none;">David incorporated Synergy Appraisal Services sixteen years ago with one simple premise: To
provide exceptional Customer Service that is uniquely designed to meet the specific business
needs of each Client. David's philosophy is to develop Win-Win-Win solutions, which are
sustainable, to deliver exceptional results for Customers.
<Br><Br>Understanding that service is only part of a winning formula for his Customers, David also
became an early advocate of implementing a quality control function to mitigate risk and
strengthen credit quality. It is no mystery why David's passion for excellent service and consistent quality has made him very successful and endeared him to Customers.

      <p>Born in Ohio, Jim is a second generation appraiser with decades of successful management experience. His 21 years of professional experience includes valuation services for asset management, eminent domain, lending, litigation, loan quality control, marketing, and relocation purposes. He regularly consults with both staff and fee appraisers regarding complex property valuations.<span class="read-more team">Read More</span></p>

<p style="display:none;">Jim has an outstanding record of providing senior leadership for appraisal organizations. Some of his past positions include Collateral Services Manager for Washington Mutual, Regional Chief Appraiser for Bank of America, Division Appraisal Manager for World Savings, and Mortgage Group Leader for Wachovia. In addition, Jim has taught appraisal licensing and continuing education courses for many years. He also develops and presents training seminars on subject matter including appraisal, compliance, market conditions, review practice, and secondary market guidelines. Jim particularly enjoys talking with other professionals about changes affecting real estate markets, as well as changes affecting professional appraisal practice.
<br><br>Jim understands that the only constant in business is change and this is especially true in the real estate industry today. He makes it a point to keep Synergy's Clients informed of the latest developments impacting our industry.

		<h8> Dianne Forebush</h8> <h7>Director of Operations <a href="mailto:dianne@synergyappraisal.com"><img src="img/mail2.png"> dianne@synergyappraisal.com</a></h7>
        <br><p><span class="read-more team bottom">Read More about Dianne</span></p>
        <p style="display:none;">Joined the Synergy Family in May 2006 with a previous background in banking and mortgage services.  As the Director of Operations, I am responsible for making sure that all of the technical systems, operational processes, financial decisions and departments are working in harmony with each other, in an efficient and a compliant manner.  My tasks vary greatly from day to day and I am presented with many learning opportunities in a wide array of fields.  Since my focus is "a little bit of everything," I enjoy the pleasure of working closely with all sorts of different people – customers, employees, vendors, clients and more!

My personal life is as varied as my professional life.   My husband, Larry, and I were blessed with a beautiful baby boy in January 2010.  Despite a premature delivery and early complications, my son Alexander is now a very healthy, playful, and active toddler.  I will be forever thankful to David and Synergy for all the support and flexibility during those first few difficult months of Al's life.  Overall, I am extremely grateful to work for a company that places so much emphasis on balancing work life with family life.

When I am not working or chasing after my son, here are some activities I enjoy doing in my free time:
•	Napping - yes, I consider this a "hobby" and I'm extremely proficient at it.
•	Kickboxing - beating up a heavy bag is a great way to de-stress after a hard day.
•	Volunteering at a local animal shelter - the only reason I only have 1 cat is because she is anti-social and would kill me if I even thought about bringing home some "friends" for her.
•	Reading – recommendations are ALWAYS welcome; please email me the title/author of your favorite book!
•	Playing the piano – I'm no Beethoven, but it's still fun to plunk away.
•	Goofing around online - hey, my computer is a great way to keep in touch with my family back in Wisconsin.
•	And last but not least, solidifying my plans on how to take over the world… I've still got a bit of work to do on this one, so stay tuned for future updates.</p>

		<h8> JAMES MORRIS</h8> <h7>  National Accounts Manager<a href="mailto:jmorris@synergyappraisal.com"><img src="img/mail2.png"> jmorris@synergyappraisal.com</a></h7>
        <br><p><span class="read-more team bottom">Read More about James</span></p>
<p style="display:none;">Joined the Synergy Family in July of 2011 after having spent almost six years managing appraisals for a huge AMC.  My educational background is in neuroscience and philosophy, especially applied ethics.  From that perspective, I have always found the appraisal business fascinating and always taken pride in working with industry professionals.  I believe we work in an economic sector that directly impacts the life of everyone in some way and, therefore, it is imperative I do the best I can to facilitate the highest quality reporting and service possible for our clients.  And I believe this can be accomplished by being respectful and professional to all parties involved – whether they are a homeowner, loan officer, processor, or appraiser.
My main role with the Synergy Family is to lead our team of Account Managers.  I help the Account Managers develop solutions when complex issues arise in our workflow.  If you have a yurt on 50 acres in Bozeman, MT, I will make calls to help your Account Manager find the most qualified local appraiser.  Does your underwriter need a comp within 90 days and the appraiser says there isn't one available in the last six months?  I will work with the appraiser and our QC team to arrive at the best possible outcome for our Client.  I believe that working as a team – both internally here at Synergy and with our Clients – we can achieve much better outcomes than by working alone.
When I am not working, I do percussion and backup vocals in an indie rock band in Southeast Michigan, where I call Ann Arbor home.  I love the city of Detroit, despite its recent challenges, and admire the wonderful people working here to rebuild this beautiful, vibrant city.  I'm a Michigan transplant, who has grown deep roots in the local community.  Although I was born in Florida, raised in West Virginia and attended college in Ohio, Michigan has been a wonderful home these last seven years.  Aside from banging drums and singing and visiting the city, I enjoy video games, reading about current events and politics (don't get me started), and spending time with family and friends.  I'm proud to work with David and Jim and the rest of our Synergy team striving to make our industry better for all involved.</p>

<h8> Chris Castro</h8> <h7>  Certified Residential Appraiser</h7><br><p><span class="read-more team bottom">Read More about Chris</span></p>
<p style="display:none;">My name is Chris Castro, I'm a Certified Residential Appraiser and have been appraising for 21 years.  I have been working with The Synergy Appraisal Services Family since 2000.  I have enjoyed my time with the company.  Although appraisal can be quite challenging, it can also be quite rewarding.
I have lived in Michigan all of my life, with the last 39 years in Canton Twp. Michigan.  My husband Andres and I have been married for almost 44 years.  We have two grown married sons, two grandsons, and two granddaughters.
I'm not fond of the Michigan winters; however, it's a beautiful green state with many lakes and parks for lots of outdoor fun.  I enjoy reading, walking, playing the card game Euchre and – most of all – spending time with family and friends.</p>
