    <h1>Our philosophy is simple:</h1>
    <h2>Quality comes first, matters most</h2>
    <h4>and endures longest.</h4>
    <div class="content5">
      <p>Synergy Appraisal Services employs a quality control process to ensure our customers receive well supported valuation services which are also properly reported.  Many competitors use software screening, which is marginally effective at best, while we employ a level of human judgment that no program can match.  Our valuation services pass through a QC Completeness Check with any revisions corrected before final delivery to clients.</p>
 
<p>Repurchase demands continue to adversely impact many of our clients. It has become clear that appraisal quality is the responsibility of the lenderâ€“ both as a fundamental component of credit quality and of risk management.  Nevertheless, we do not believe our customers' responsibility diminishes our obligation to deliver high-quality valuation services.  In fact, we are so adamant about quality being an essential component of our value-added service that QC Completeness Checks are provided at no charge. QC Completeness Checks involve a close screening of each report to ensure it is complete, appropriately signed and dated, contains the required exhibits, includes sufficient commentary to facilitate sound lending decisions and meets each customer's unique underwriting guidelines.</p>
  
<p>In addition to the QC Completeness Check, our expert appraisers specialize in review practice. Synergy Appraisal Services offers comprehensive review appraisals compliant with USPAP Standard 3: Appraisal Review, Development and Reporting.  Our Desk, Desk Reconciliation, Field, and Field Reconciliation Reviews provide the assurance needed regarding credible value opinions, as well as fulfilling audit requirements for quality control sampling and risk mitigation for repurchase demands.</p>
</div>
	<div id="spacer2"></div>
	<h2>Compliance has become</h2> <h4>more complicated &amp; costly for our</h4> <h4>industry than ever before.</h4>
    <div class="content5">
    <p>Appraisal is a technical specialty.  Without specific functional training staff responsible for the appraisal function may not be fully aware of the significant financial costs and severe reputational risks associated with non-compliance.  We develop and deliver customized training for agents, loan officers, origination managers, processors, risk managers and underwriters to empower them with a clear understanding of how to comply with the new appraiser independence regulations in Dodd-Frank. Our training presentations are well-received and provide valuable professional development opportunities at no charge.</p>

<p>Unless an institution has a specialized functional team to administer, assign, communicate, compensate and manage appraisers, it may unintentionally incur compliance violations.  In addition, unless a lending institution has review appraisers on staff, it is unlikely to be effective at evaluating appraisal quality and compliance as required by Dodd-Frank's new Mandatory Reporting provision.</p>

<p>The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (H.R. 4173) includes "Appraiser Independence Requirements" (Section 1472, Subsection 129E).  These new regulations replace the HVCC and are much more comprehensive.  Section 1472 includes strong prohibitions against attempts to unduly influence appraisers, clear definitions regarding appropriate communication protocols, strict requirements for managing appraisers and the appraisal process, and two controversial provisions: Mandatory Reporting and Customary and Reasonable Fee.</p>


<p>Since Dodd-Frank includes regulations implemented by many federal agencies&mdash;such as the FDIC, OCC, NCUA, and BCFP&mdash;and significant amendments to TILA, FIRREA, RESPA and ECOA, it is imperative that clients understand the best ways to ensure compliance with these far-reaching regulatory changes.</p>
